Twitter data analysis - The Afghan Situation

This repsitory contains code related to a research project about social media dynamics in the context on Twitter. During the Summer 2021, in the period of the Fall of Kabul and the American withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan, I analyzed twitter data related to the afghan geopolitical situatio, to explore the main features that characterized the public discussion about one of the most relevant gepolitical events of the latest years. To do it, I went through text mining techniques, like Sentiment Analysis and Topi Modeling.

**DataAnalysis.ipynb** 

In the jupyter sheet DataAnalysis.ipynb, I reported a representation of the techniques and the code that I used, reproduced on a smaller sample. Here you can find all the analytical process, from the exploration and the cleaning of the dataset, to the analysis of the topics generated by the Topic Modeling algorithm that I used.

**afghanistan1.csv**
**afghanistan2.csv**
**afghanistan3csv**

In the three "afghanistan" csv files, you can file the IDs of the tweets that I scraped and analyzed in my project. If you have API key permission, you can easily hydrate tweets by using specific functions, like <a href=https://rdrr.io/cran/academictwitteR/man/hydrate_tweets.html>this</A>.
