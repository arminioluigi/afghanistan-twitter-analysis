Twitter data analysis - The Afghan Situation

This repsitory contains code related to a research project about social media dynamics in the context on Twitter. During the Summer 2021, in the period of the Fall of Kabul and the American withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan, I analyzed twitter data related to the afghan geopolitical situatio, to explore the main features that characterized the public discussion about one of the most relevant gepolitical events of the latest years. To do it, I went through text mining techniques, like Sentiment Analysis and Topi Modeling.
